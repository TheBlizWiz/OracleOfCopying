Rendering Pipeline:

-- atlasgen.exe --

1.  Load all .qoi files used in a level from disk
2.  Convert them to SDL_Surfaces
3.  Place them into a new atlas image .qoi file in the most efficient way possible
4.  Write individual SDL_Surface metadata into a new .json file
5.  Merge all SDL_Surfaces into one massive SDL_Surface
6.  De-convert merged SDL_Surface into .qoi file
7.  Save .qoi file as atlas image

-- ooc.exe --

8.  Load atlas image .qoi file
9.  Load atlas metadata .json file
10. Create new merged SDL_Surface
11. Convert to merged SDL_Texture
12. As needed for rendering, create new individual SDL_Textures from the merged SDL_Texture
